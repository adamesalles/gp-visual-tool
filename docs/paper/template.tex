Gaussian Processes (GPs)~\cite{rasmussen2006gaussian} have gained significant attention in the field of machine learning and data analysis due to their ability to model complex and non-linear relationships while providing probabilistic predictions. GPs have found applications in various domains, including regression, classification, time series analysis, and Bayesian optimization. However, understanding and interpreting GP models can be challenging, requiring effective visualization techniques and interactive tools.

The motivation behind developing the Gaussian Processes Visual Tool stems from the need for a user-friendly and intuitive tool that enables users to visualize and explore GP models efficiently. Traditional methods often fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of GP models, hindering their widespread adoption. By addressing these challenges, the tool aims to democratize the usage of GPs and empower practitioners in leveraging their potential.

\subsection{Objectives and Scope of the Tool}

The tool's scope encompasses several key features and functionalities. Users can visualize the posterior distribution of the latent function $f$ in real-time. By clicking anywhere on the visualization, users can make observations and update the posterior distribution accordingly. This dynamic interaction allows users to explore the effects of observations on the model predictions and uncertainties.

The tool offers a list of different kernel functions to choose from, and users can set hyperparameters for each kernel. This flexibility enables users to customize the model's behavior and capture various types of patterns and relationships in the data.

In addition, the tool provides simulation options, allowing users to set the axis parameters, variance of the likelihood, and even upload their own datasets. This versatility empowers users to explore different scenarios and analyze their own data within the tool.

It offers a seamless user experience, encompassing visualization of the posterior distribution, hyperparameter customization, simulation options, and dataset upload. The tool's comprehensive approach distinguishes it from existing projects that often focus on specific aspects of GP modeling.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Gaussian Processes}

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful probabilistic models that have gained significant attention in the field of machine learning and data analysis. GPs provide a flexible framework for modeling complex relationships in data, making them well-suited for tasks such as regression, classification, time series analysis, and Bayesian optimization.

At its core, a Gaussian Process is defined as a collection of random variables, any finite number of which follow a joint Gaussian distribution. In simpler terms, a GP defines a distribution over functions rather than specific function values. Each point in the input space is associated with a random variable, and the covariance between these variables encodes the similarity between inputs.

GPs offer several advantages over traditional regression or classification models. First, GPs provide a non-parametric approach, meaning they do not assume a specific functional form for the underlying relationship. This flexibility allows GPs to capture complex and non-linear patterns in the data without being constrained by predefined assumptions.

Second, GPs provide probabilistic predictions, offering a measure of uncertainty for each prediction. This uncertainty estimation is particularly valuable in scenarios where decision-making relies on reliable confidence bounds or when the data is limited or noisy. The probabilistic nature of GPs also enables Bayesian inference, where prior knowledge and observed data can be combined to update beliefs about the underlying function.

Third, GPs can handle different types of inputs, including scalar values, vectors, or even structured data. This versatility makes GPs applicable to a wide range of domains and problem types.

To use GPs for regression or classification, a key step involves specifying a covariance function, often referred to as a kernel function. The choice of kernel function determines the assumed characteristics of the underlying function, such as smoothness, periodicity, or linearity. Popular kernel functions include the squared exponential, Matérn, and linear kernels.

In practice, Gaussian Processes can be trained using various inference methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), or variational inference. The trained GP model can then be used for making predictions on new, unseen data points by leveraging the learned distribution over functions.

Overall, Gaussian Processes provide a flexible and probabilistic framework for modeling complex relationships in data. By capturing uncertainties and offering non-parametric modeling capabilities, GPs have found wide applications in machine learning, statistics, and various scientific domains.

\subsection{Gaussian Processes for Regression}

For our purposes, we focus on Gaussian Processes for regression tasks. In this setting, we assume that the observed data points are generated by a latent function $f$ with Gaussian noise $\epsilon$:

\begin{equation}
    y = f(x) + \epsilon
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the input and $y$ is the output. The goal of regression is to learn the underlying function $f$ from the observed data points and make predictions on new, unseen data points.

In the context of GPs, the latent function $f$ is assumed to follow a Gaussian Process:

\begin{equation}
    f \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\cdot), k(\cdot, \cdot))
\end{equation}

where $m(\cdot)$ is the mean function and $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the covariance function, also known as the kernel function. The mean function $m(\cdot)$ is often assumed to be zero, and the kernel function $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ is used to encode the assumed characteristics of the underlying function, such as smoothness, periodicity, or linearity.

Given a set of observed data points $\mathcal{D} = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$, the goal is to learn the posterior distribution over functions $p(f|\mathcal{D})$. This posterior distribution can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data points $x^*$:

\begin{equation}
    p(y^*|x^*, \mathcal{D}) = \int p(y^*|x^*, f) p(f|\mathcal{D})\ df
\end{equation}

where $p(y^*|x^*, f)$ is the likelihood function, and $p(f|\mathcal{D})$ is the posterior distribution over functions. The posterior distribution $p(f|\mathcal{D})$ is a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$:

\begin{equation}
    p(f|\mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)
\end{equation}
  
  where $\mu = K(X, X)K(X, X)^{-1}y$ and $\Sigma = K(X, X) - K(X, X)K(X, X)^{-1}K(X, X)$.

\subsection{Kernels for Gaussian Processes}

The choice of kernel function determines the assumed characteristics of the underlying function. For example, the squared exponential kernel encodes the assumption that the underlying function is smooth, while the Matérn kernel encodes the assumption that the underlying function is not smooth.

They must follow some properties to be valid kernels. For example, a valid kernel must be symmetric, positive semi-definite, and must satisfy the Mercer's condition. A kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ is symmetric if $k(x, y) = k(y, x)$ for all $x, y \in \mathcal{X}$. A kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ is positive semi-definite if for any finite set of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathcal{X}$, the corresponding kernel matrix $K$ is positive semi-definite. A kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot)$ satisfies the Mercer's condition if for any finite set of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathcal{X}$, the corresponding kernel matrix $K$ is symmetric and positive semi-definite.

Some famous examples are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Squared Exponential Kernel:\\ $k(x, x';\ \sigma^2, l) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\frac{1}{2l^2}d(x,x'))$
  \item Matérn Kernel:\\ $k(x, x';\ \sigma^2, l, \nu) = \sigma^2 \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d(x, x')}{l})^\nu K_\nu(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d(x, x')}{l})$
  \item Linear Kernel: $k(x, x'; \sigma^2) = \sigma^2 x^Tx'$
  \item Periodic Kernel:\\ $k(x, x'; \sigma^2, l, p) = \sigma^2 \exp(-\frac{2}{l^2}\sin^2(\frac{\pi}{p}d(x, x')))$
  \item Cosine Kernel:\\ $k(x, x'; \sigma^2, p) = \sigma^2 \cos(\frac{\pi}{p}d(x, x'))$
\end{itemize}

for $x, x' \in \mathcal{X}$, where $d(x, x')$ is the Euclidean distance between $x$ and $x'$, $\sigma^2$ is the variance, $l$ is the length scale, $\nu$ is the smoothness parameter, and $p$ is the period.


\subsection{Limitations of Gaussian Processes}

While Gaussian Processes offer several advantages, they also have certain limitations that need to be considered:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Computational Complexity -} GPs can become computationally expensive as the number of data points increases. Inference in GPs involves inverting the covariance matrix, which scales cubically with the number of data points. This computational complexity can limit the scalability of GPs to large datasets.

  \item \textbf{Choice of Kernel and Hyperparameters -} The performance of a GP model is highly sensitive to the choice of kernel function and hyperparameters. Selecting the appropriate kernel and tuning the hyperparameters often requires domain expertise and careful experimentation. It can be challenging to determine the most suitable kernel for a specific problem, and the performance of the GP model may vary depending on these choices.

  \item \textbf{Interpretability -} While GPs provide flexibility in modeling complex relationships, the resulting models may lack interpretability compared to simpler models. The black-box nature of GPs makes it challenging to directly interpret the learned parameters or understand the exact functional form of the underlying relationship.

  \item \textbf{Limited Extrapolation -} GPs are best suited for interpolation within the observed data range. Extrapolation, i.e., making predictions outside the range of observed data, can be unreliable and highly uncertain. GPs tend to revert to the prior distribution as data points move further away from the observed range, leading to potentially unreliable predictions.

  \end{itemize}

Understanding these limitations is crucial when applying Gaussian Processes in practice. Depending on the specific problem and data characteristics, alternative approaches or modifications to GPs may be more suitable.

\section{Related Work}

The Related Work section provides an overview of existing research and tools related to Gaussian Processes, data visualization, and interactive machine learning applications. It highlights the contributions and advancements made in these areas and positions the Gaussian Processes Visual Tool within the broader research landscape.

\subsection{Gaussian Processes Visualization}

There are many known approaches for visualizing Gaussian Processes. Each approach offers unique advantages and limitations, and the choice of visualization technique depends on the specific problem and data characteristics. The Gaussian Processes Visual Tool aims to provide a flexible and interactive visualization tool that can be adapted to various use cases.

For example, \cite{gortler2019a} is an interactive paper that offers many interesting visualizations of Gaussian Processes. The paper provides an overview of GPs and their applications, highlighting the advantages of GPs over traditional regression methods. It also discusses the limitations of GPs and the challenges of applying GPs in practice. Though, it does not provide a tool for visualizing or using GPs.

In~\cite{smlbook}, on the other hand, the authors produce something really similar to our approach, but keeping it simple - without custom data and some personalization options. It uses Svelte as well.

And, of course, it would be really worth to cite~\cite{gpguide} as one of the most complete guides on Gaussian Processes. Again, like we saw on the previous paper, it does not provide an actual tool.

\subsection{Future work}

By addressing the following future work aspects, the Gaussian Processes Visual Tool can further expand its capabilities, flexibility, and usability, empowering users to explore and analyze GP models more comprehensively.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Add more visualizations -} Currently, the Gaussian Processes Visual Tool provides visualizations of the posterior distribution and model predictions. In future work, additional visualizations can be incorporated, such as a heatmap of the covariance matrix. This visualization would provide insights into the correlations between different input variables, helping users understand the relationships within the data and their impact on the GP model.

  \item \textbf{Add more kernels -} The tool currently supports a range of kernel functions for GP modeling.

  \item \textbf{Deploy it to a server -} Currently, the tool is available for local use. Future work can involve deploying the Gaussian Processes Visual Tool to a server, making it accessible via a web interface. This would enable users to access the tool remotely, collaborate with others, and utilize its functionalities without the need for local installation. Server deployment would also facilitate continuous updates and improvements to the tool.

  \item \textbf{Add math explanations to the tool -} To enhance user understanding, future work can focus on incorporating math explanations directly into the tool. This could involve providing tooltips or annotations that explain the mathematical concepts and formulas used in Gaussian Processes. By providing contextual explanations within the tool, users would gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions.

  \item \textbf{ Operations between kernels -} Gaussian Processes allow for combining and manipulating different kernel functions to create more complex models. Future work can explore the addition of operations between kernels within the tool. Users could have the ability to perform operations such as addition, multiplication, or composition of kernels, enabling them to create custom kernels that capture specific relationships and structures in the data.
